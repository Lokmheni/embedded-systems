 *
 * USAGE of wifi:
 * 1)   When using wifi.h inteface, it is up to the user to first call @ref
 *      wifi_connect_network() to connect to the wifi and set up a port.
 *
 * 2)   After the wifi has been enabled and one wants to play with other
 *      players, it is vital to announce this using @ref announce_lfg(). One can
 *      optionally send this message periodically, but it must be sent at least
 *      once upon connecting to the network.
 *
 * 3)   The user is responsible for periodically polling incoming messages with
 *      @ref receive_messages(). Upon receiving an LFG msg, the receiver becomes
 *      the `master` and is in charge of syncing game (with commands such as
 *      RESET_GAME and IS_PLAY defined in @ref wifi_instr.h )
 *
 * 4)   During game, for every frame send !LOCAL! player  with @ref
 *      send_status(Player* const plr) and the function will arbitrate whether
 *      or not a transmission needs to be sent or not.
 *
 * 5)   Whenever a player does damage, this is to be sent to the remote NDS
 *      using @ref send_damage(u8 dmg_x, u8 dmg_y, u8 dmg)
 *
 * 6)   During the game, it is important to periodically poll for incoming
 *       messages (again with @ref receive_messages()) and handle the (player,
 *      damage or abort) instructions.
 *
 * 7)   Whoever loses the game (health, giveup, whatever) is in charge of
 *      signalling the lose and becomes the new master, tasked with setting up a
 *      new round etc.
 *
 * 8)   To disconnect from wifi (i.e. single player) call @ref
 *      wifi_disconnect_network()
 *
